# Exploratory Data Analysis on NBA 2007-2021 Season

## Description:
In this project, I used a NBA dataset from the 2007-2021 seasons to do exploratory data analysis using Python's data science libraries (Pandas and Matplotlib). This project serves to be my first project in data science, where I learned key tools for data analysis and visualization in the programming language Python. Throughout the project, I aimed to answer various questions that I was interested in, such as the amount of years it takes for a player to get into the All NBA First Team. 

## Tools:
• Pandas: 
  • I used this library to do most of the data analysis, where I merged, aggregated, and analyzed data from 4 different .csv files.
• Matplotlib: 
  • Using matplotlib allows me to create visuals to visualize some of the data I was interested in, such as Kevin Durant's PPG each season. 

## Challenges and improvements:
• This project's purpose is an opportunity for me to learn Pandas and Matplotlib so I did face challenges in familiarizing myself with the functions each library offer.
• For future improvemens, I aim to explore even more functions each tool offers, especially using Matplotlib to create better visuals.
